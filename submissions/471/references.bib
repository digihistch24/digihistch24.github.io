	title = {Tracing and {Telling}: {Exploring} collection holdings through graph-based narratives},
	abstract = {Cultural collections have transcended the boundaries of physical showcases and storage cabinets, evolving into intricate digital webs of interconnected data. The research project Restaging Fashion aimed to expand the possibilities for experiencing the linkages in digitized cultural heritage, focusing on the visualization of collection holdings related to the history of garments. Through graph-based narratives, the project investigated the complex interplay between the linear – and at times tentative – art historical discourses and the non-linear explorations of associated cultural heritage data. The resulting visualizations have been designed with the aim to allow for curated and dynamic exploration of the collection along research essays and their interrelated graphs.},

	abstract = {After decades of massive digitisation, an unprecedented number of historical documents are available in digital format, along with their machine-readable texts. While this represents a major step forward with respect to preservation and accessibility, it also opens up new opportunities in terms of content mining and the next fundamental challenge is to develop appropriate technologies to efficiently search, retrieve, and explore information from this ‘big data of the past’. Among semantic indexing opportunities, the recognition and classification of named entities are in great demand among humanities scholars. Yet, named entity recognition (NER) systems are heavily challenged with diverse, historical, and noisy inputs. In this survey, we present the array of challenges posed by historical documents to NER, inventory existing resources, describe the main approaches deployed so far, and identify key priorities for future developments.},
