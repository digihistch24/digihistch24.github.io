## Book of Abstracts Digital History Switzerland 2024

We compiled a book of abstracts containing all the papers presented at the conference to provide a comprehensive overview of current research at the intersection of history and digital technology. These papers cover a range of topics, from innovative methodologies and software applications to the challenges of digital data management and algorithmic analysis in historical research.

We are pleased to present this collection, which reflects the state of the art in digital history, and anticipate that the discussions it stimulates will make a significant contribution to the field.
