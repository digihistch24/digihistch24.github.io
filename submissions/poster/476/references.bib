It may well manage the feat."--The Economist"Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century is an intellectual tour de force, a triumph of economic history over the theoretical, mathematical modeling that has come to dominate the economics profession in recent years."--Steven Pearlstein, Washington Post"Piketty has written an extraordinarily important book...In its scale and sweep it brings us back to the founders of political economy."--Martin Wolf, Financial Times"A sweeping account of rising inequality...Piketty has written a book that nobody interested in a defining issue of our era can afford to ignore."--John Cassidy, New Yorker"Stands a fair chance of becoming the most influential work of economics yet published in our young century. It is the most important study of inequality in over fifty years."--Timothy Shenk, The Nation},
